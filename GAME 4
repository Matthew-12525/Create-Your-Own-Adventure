I want to take advantage of strings and their various uses to make a guessing game that rewards the player with +50 playerHealth if they get it right. \
I'll print one letter of the mystery word at the end of every pacifist option(ex: avoiding the fight with the ogre, working for the goblin, etc.) \
The word will be STRING, and the possibility to get the extra health will come right before the boss fight:)
